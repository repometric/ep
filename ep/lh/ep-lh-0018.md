## Abstract

This document describes the structure of engine output.

## Motivation

lhexec [`ep-lh-0014`](#related) work with many engines. To use each engine need to unify output of engine. This enhancement will define how to unify output engine.

## Proposal

The output of each engine should is an array. Each item of array is described by:

- `path` - The path relative to the analysis root
- `messages` - List of messages in the path

## Messages

Messages is a array of errors. Each `message` describe error and where is he located, and represent a JSON object with the following properties:

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| message     | string   | +        | The short description of the message |
| description | string   | -        | The explanatory text of the message  |
| severity    | string   | +        | The severity of the message: “verbose”, “hint”, “information”, “warning” or “error” |
| line        | integer  | +        | The line where the message is located|
| lineEnd     | integer  | -        | The end line where the message is located (the same as line by default)|
| column      | integer  | -        | The column where the message is located |
| columnEnd   | integer  | -        | The end column where the message is located |
| ruleId      | string   | -        | The id of the rule that produced the message |
| ruleName    | string   | -        | The name of the rule that produced the message |
| ruleNs      | string   | -        | The namespace of the rule that produced the message |

## Example

Here is the full example for structure of engine output:

```json
[
    {
        "path": "pathToFile",
        "messages": [
            {
                "message":"Error message",
                "description": "Description of error",
                "severity":"error",
                "line":"1",
                "lineEnd":"2",
                "column":"1",
                "columnEnd": "2",
                "ruleId":"ruleId",
                "ruleName":"rule name",
                "ruleNs": "namespace of rule"
            },
            {
                "message":"Another error message",
                "severity":"error #2",
                "line":"2"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
