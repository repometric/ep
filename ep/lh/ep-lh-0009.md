## Abstract

This document describes the `lhman` - tool that allows to request engine's catalog, install engines and prepare necessary environment.

## Motivation

linterhub is a catalog that contains the information necessary to install, run and process the result of the work of the `linter`. To start working, you need a utility that allows you to centrally install the linter from the existing catalog.

## Proposal

lhman is a utility that allows you to obtain the catalog of linters and install them. For the implementation of the functional lhman is divided into `strategies`.

## Strategies

lhman implements the following strategies:

| Name         | Description                          |
| -            | -                                    |
| catalog      | Get engines catalog                  |
| install      | Install engine (or multiple engines) |
| help         | Show help                            |
| version      | Get lhman version                    |

> By default, space is used as delimiter between argument and value. The equal sign is also admissible. If an array passed as an argument, then it is recommended to use the comma sign to separate values. In addition, multiple declaration of arguments is allowed as an alternative. Example: `lhman strategy --arg1=value1,value2 --arg2 value1 --arg2=value2`

### catalog

This strategy generates list of engines using filters or specific keys and propose recommendations

| Argument    | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                               |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -                                                                                                                         |
| filter      | string   | -        | Engine name (or engine id) to install [ep-lh-0002](#related)                                                              |
| keys        | string   | -        | Engine version (latest supported version by default)                                                                                |
| bundle      | string   | -        | Generate a bundle with `metadata`, `arguments` and `dependencies` for all engines. Argument requires file name as string. |
| engine      | string   | -        | Engine name to return `metadata`, `arguments` and `dependencies`                                                          |
| project     | string   | -        | Project path to return list of recommended for installing engines                                                         |

Here is command to get only `name` and `description` properties of each supported engine.

`lhman catalog --key=name,description`

```json
{
    "linters": [
        {
            "name": "enginename1",
            "description": "Description of enginename1",
        },
        {
            "name": "enginename2",
            "description": "Description of enginename1",
        }
    ]
}
```

### install

The install strategy allows to install the engine and its dependencies. 

| Argument    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| engine      | string   | +        | Engine name to install [ep-lh-0002](#related) |
| version     | string   | -        | Engine version (latest version by default) |
| project     | string   | -        | Project to associate with |
| environment | string   | -        | The way how to install engine. Allowed values: `local`, `global`, `container`. `local` is used by default. |

There are 3 main ways how to deploy engine:
* As global package. After installing the engine, it will be available globally in the entire system. Remember that this action may require root privileges. For this reason, this type of installation is not recommended.
* As local package for current project. The engine will be installed in the location used by the `package manager` to store the project dependencies.
* Using docker. This action will create a docker container in which the engine will be installed with all the necessary environment for work (based on [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) docker image)

Here is command example for installing engine 'enginename' as global package.

`lhman install --engine=enginename --environment=global`

```json
{
    "engines": [
        {
            "name": "enginename",
            "result": false,
            "environment": "global",
            "requirements": [
                {
                    "manager": "system",
                    "package": "npm",
                    "errors": null
                },
                {
                    "manager": "npm",
                    "package": "enginename",
                    "version": "1.0.0",
                    "engine": true,
                    "errors": "Some errors from npm"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, the engine was not installed, because npm returned an error.

### help

This strategy shows help text with possible strategies and their descriptions.

> Each strategy has own help page. For example, `lhman catalog help` will show help page for catalog strategy.

### version

Returns current lhman version. 

## Unresolved

- Docker container management
- Check that engine is already installed
- Create references to schema files
