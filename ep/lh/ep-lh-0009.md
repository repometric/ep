## Abstract

This document describes the `lhman` - core component ([ep-lh-0017](#related)) that allows to request engine's catalog, install engines and prepare necessary environment.

## Motivation

Linterhub is a catalog that contains the information necessary to install, run and process the result of the work of the `linter`. To start working, you need a utility that allows you to centrally install the linter from the existing catalog.

## Proposal

lhman is a utility that allows you to obtain the catalog of linters and install them. For the implementation of the functional lhman is divided into `strategies` ([ep-lh-0017](#related)).

## Strategies

lhman implements the following strategies:

| Name         | Description                          |
| -            | -                                    |
| catalog      | Get engines catalog                  |
| install      | Install engine (or multiple engines) |
| help         | Show help                            |
| version      | Get lhman version                    |

> `help` and `version` startegies are common for all `core components` and described in ([ep-lh-0017](#related)).

### catalog

This strategy generates list of engines using filters or specific keys and propose recommendations.

| Argument    | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                               |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -                                                                                                                         |
| engine      | string   | -        | Engine name to return `metadata`, `arguments` and `dependencies`                                                          |
| project     | string   | -        | Project path to return list of recommended for installing engines                                                         |
| verison     | -        | -        | Show catalog version                                                                                                      |

Here is command to get catalog of linters (only `name` and `descirption` propertyies are shown).

`lhman catalog`

Execution result:

```json
{
    "linters": [
        {
            "name": "enginename1",
            "description": "Description of enginename1",
        },
        {
            "name": "enginename2",
            "description": "Description of enginename1",
        }
    ]
}
```

The visual representation of result:

```
.
└── linters/
    ├── name
    ├── description
    ├── version
    ...
```

Each object of linters array is an instence of [Meta shema](#references)

### install

The install strategy allows to install the engine and its dependencies.

| Argument    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| engine      | string   | +        | Engine name to install [ep-lh-0002](#related) |
| version     | string   | -        | Engine version (latest version by default) |
| folder      | string   | -        | Folder path for local installation |
| environment | string   | -        | The way how to install engine. Allowed values: `local`, `global`, `container`. `local` is used by default. |

There are 3 main ways how to deploy engine:

* As global package. After installing the engine, it will be available globally in the entire system. Remember that this action may require root privileges. For this reason, this type of installation is not recommended.
* As local package in specified folder. The engine will be installed in the location used by the `package manager` to store the local dependencies.
* Using docker. This action will create a docker container in which the engine will be installed with all the necessary environment for work (based on [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) docker image)

Here is command example for installing engine 'enginename' as global package.

`lhman install --engine=enginename --environment=global`

Execution result:

```json
{
    "engines": [
        {
            "name": "enginename",
            "success": false,
            "environment": "global",
            "requirements": [
                {
                    "manager": "platform",
                    "package": "npm",
                    "errors": null
                },
                {
                    "manager": "npm",
                    "package": "enginename",
                    "version": "1.0.0",
                    "engine": true,
                    "errors": "Some errors from npm"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The visual representation of result:

```
.
└── engines/
    ├── name
    ├── success
    ├── environment
    └── requirements/
        ├── manager
        ├── package
        ├── version
        ├── engine
        └── errors
```

In this example, the engine was not installed, because npm returned an error.

## Unresolved

* Docker container management.
* Check that engine is already installed
* Create references to schema files
* Describe `recommendations` logic of `catalog` strategy
