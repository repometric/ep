## Abstract

This document describes the structure of engine arguments used in linterhub as mentioned in [`ep-lh-0001`](#related).

## Motivation

There are a lot of engines of different types, distributed in different ways and they may require specific runtime environment and complex configuration for execution. This enhancement will unify how engine dependencies are described.

## Proposal

Each engine must have `deps.json` file in JSON Schema format which should describe:

- `dependencies` - all available installation dependencies for engine.

The visual representation of that file is the following:

```
.
├── id
├── name
└── dependencies/
    ├── manager
    ├── package
    ├── version
    └── engine
```

### Schema

Each engine must have `deps.json` file with the following properties:

| Property     | Type     | Required | Description |
| -            | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| id           | string   | -        | Engine id, case insensitive unique identifier, required only if the engine name is not unique |
| name         | string   | +        | Case sensitive official engine name, may not be unique |
| dependencies | object[] | -        | The complex object which describe several sub-schemas |

This is information that allows identifying engine. As for dependencies property - it's an array of 'dependency resoulution apporaches' or 'dependency way' just 'dependency'. Each of them it is an array itself which contains information about requirements. This allows to specify several ways how engine environment could be prepared (for example on different ways for different OS). At least one of dependency way requirements should be satisfied in order to execute engine.

### Requirement

| Property  | Type     | Required | Description |
| -         | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| manager   | string   | +        | Some abstract dependency manager which is used for installation; allowed values are defined in [ep-lh-0013](#related) |
| package   | string   | +        | The package that is required and could be installed via manager |
| version   | string   | -        | Version of that package in a format of manager (so, 'version' from other sources may differ) |
| engine    | boolean  | -        | The flag indication whether this is engine itself |

The corresponding schemas located at [`./schema/deps.json`](#references).

## Example

> Note: already implemented deps can be found in the linterhub [repository](#references).

Here is the full example for engine 'enginename'.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://repometric.github.io/linterhub/schema/deps.json",
    "id": "enginename",
    "name": "enginename",
    "requirements": [
        [
            {
                "manager": "manager1",
                "package": "tool1"
            },
            {
                "manager": "manager2",
                "package": "enginemane",
                "version": "1.0.0",
                "engine": true
            }
        ]
    ]
}
```
