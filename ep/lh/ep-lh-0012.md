## Abstract

This document describes the software licenses used in linterhub as mentioned in [`ep-lh-0002`](#related).

## Motivation

There are a lot of `engines` and each can have a different license. For use, each `engine` needs to define a license working on it. This enhancement will define how to use the engine and his license.

## Proposal

The list of commonly found licenses and exceptions used in free and open sources and other collaborative software or documentation can be retrieved from [`SPDX`](#references).

The list of licenses should be put in `licenses.json` file in JSON Schema format which should describe:

- `enum` - all available licenses under which a `engine` works.

The visual representation of that file is the following:

```
.
├── title
├── description
├── type
└── enum
```

### Schema

File `licenses.json` must have the following properties:

| Property      | Type    | Required | Description |
| -             | :-:     | :-:      | -           |
| title         | string  | -        | File title. |
| description   | string  | -        | File description. |
| type          | string  | -        | This is a constant and always must be a `string`. |
| enum          | array   | +        | Array of short names of the licenses. |

This is the information that allows identifying the license of the most popular `engine`.

The corresponding schema is located in [`./schema/licenses.json`](#references).

### Example

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema",
    "title": "This schema describes the engine license",
    "description": "The autogenerated name of SPDX license",
    "type": "string",
    "enum": [
        "0BSD",
        "AGPL-1.0"
    ],
}
```
