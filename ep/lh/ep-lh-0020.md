## Abstract

This document describes the structure of extra engine data used in linterhub as mentioned in [`ep-lh-0001`](#related).

## Motivation

There are a lot of engines of different types, launching in different ways and requiring various arguments to run their reporters. The enhancement will unify how extra data about engine is described.

## Proposal

Each engine must have `extr.json` file in JSON Schema format which should describe:

- `pipeline`, `environment` - It makes proper usage of engine possible. Whether to write command-line options before path in engine cli or vice-versa, which prefix to use while launcing engine, how  to launch reporter, what default arguments to use for the command-line options understand how engine could be named.


The visual representation of that file is the following:

```
.
├──id
├──name
└── pipeline/
    |	├──prefix
    ...			
├── environment/
    |   ├── executable
    |   ├── masks
    |   ├── success
    |   └── version	

```

### Schema

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| id          | string   | -        | Engine id, case insensitive unique identifier, required only if the engine name is not unique |
| name        | string   | +        | Case sensitive official engine name, may not be unique |

### Pipeline

Pipeline is an ordered chain of elements, containing command-line options, their prefixes, postfixes, which allows to get a specific output format after executing.
`prefix` is an object, containing following fields:
	`cmd` : command-line argument which does some preparations for the engine launching
	`success`: exit code in case of successful execution.
`option` is an object, containing following fields:
	`cmd` : command-line option the engine can execute
	`success`: exit code in case of successful execution.
`postfix` is is an object contaoining following fields:
	`cmd` : command-line argument which allows to restruct engine output somehow or change it in any way.
	`success`: exit code in case of successful execution.

### Environment

 This is a JSON Schema object, which store the following information:

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| executable  | string   | -        | The engine executable name, the name that used in the OS may differ from the official name; if not set then assumed that it's equal to engine name |
| masks       | boolean  | -        | Whether filename masks are supported by engine, default is true |
| success     | number   | -        | Success exit code, if not set then it's assumed equal to 0 |
| version     | string   | -        | The engine version, equal to the output of version command, it may be used for debugging purposes; by default it's assumed that engine doesn't support that feature |

The corresponding schema is located at [`./schema/extr.json`](#references).

## Example

> Note: already implemented args can be found in the linterhub [repository](#references).

Here is the full example for engine 'enginename'.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://repometric.github.io/linterhub/schema/extr.json",
    "id": "enginename",
    "name": "enginename",
    "pipeline": {
	"prefix":{
		"cmd":"prefix",
		"success":"0"
        },
	"option":{
		"cmd":"command-line option",
		"success":"0"
	},
	"postfix":{
		"cmd":"postfix",
		"success":"0"	
	}
    },
    "environment": {
		"executable":"enginename",
		"masks":"true",
		"success":"0",
		"version":"true"
    }
}
```

## Unresolved

Prefixes:

| Prefix      | Example          | Meaning  |
| -           | -                | -        |
| ""          | argumentName     | There is no prefix, readonly argument and it's value could not be changed |
| "arg"       | arg:argumentName | Influence the analysis and it's allowed to change the value |
| "linterhub" | linterhub:postfix| Reserved argument and it's value could not be changed, it's computed on the fly.  |
