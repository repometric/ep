## Abstract

This document describes programming languages and their extensions used in linterhub as mentioned in [`ep-lh-0002`](#related).

## Motivation

There are a lot of programming languages and for usage of each `engine` it is necessary to define a list of languages and their extensions. This enhancement will define how to use engine with its languages and their extensions.

## Proposal

[Linguist](#references) has a list of languages and their extensions and which should be put in `languages.json` file in JSON Schema format.

### Schema

File `languages.json` must have the following properties:

| Property      | Type    | Required | Description |
| -             | :-:     | :-:      | -           |
| enum          | array   | +        | An Array names of language |
| extensions    | array   | -        | An Array of associated extensions for that language |

This is the information that allows identifying the language and their extensions of the most popular `engine`.

The corresponding schema is located in [`./schema/languages.json`](#references).

### Example

Here is the full example of 'languages.json'.

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema",
    "title": "This schema describes programming languages and extensions",
    "description": "The autogenerated list of programming languages and extensions from linguist project",
    "oneOf": [
        {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/language"
        }
    ],
    "definitions": {
        "language": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The programming language name",
            "oneOf": [
                {
                    "enum": [
                        "1C Enterprise"
                    ],
                    "extensions": [
                        ".bsl",
                        ".os"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "enum": [
                        "CoffeeScript"
                    ],
                    "extensions": [
                        ".coffee",
                        "._coffee",
                        ".cake",
                        ".cjsx",
                        ".iced"
                    ]
                },
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
