## Abstract

This document describes the structure of reporter file used in linterhub with the aim of unifying engine's output.

## Motivation

There are a lot of engines which have various output structures, this doesn't allow `lh-exec` to use their output. The aim is to unify the structure of engines output using special reporter files. 

## Proposal

Each engine must have `reporter` file which should restructure engine's output to the format described in [ep-lh-0018](#references)
