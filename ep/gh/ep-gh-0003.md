## Abstract

This document contains the list of recommendations regarding repository documentation (based on [Open Source Guides](#related)). Recommendations are intentionally generic and doesn't try to impose a specific project structure and/or specific programming language. This documentation is mostly about repository, not about the project itself.

## Motivation

Have enough information about the repository as well as guidelines how to contribute.

## Proposal

The proposal is to have those files as a required minimal documentation for any project:

```
.
├── .github/                         # Reserved name for GitHub content
|   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/              # Named templates for issues
|   |   ├── ISSUE.md                 # New 'Issue' template
|   |   ├── FEATURE.md               # New 'Feature request' template
|   |   ├── MAINTENANCE.md           # New 'Maintenance request' template
|   |   ├── QUESTION.md              # New 'Question' template
|   |   └── ...                      # Other Project-specific templates 
|   ├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md           # Code of conduct
|   ├── CONTRIBUTING.md              # Guidelines for contributors
|   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md            # Default issue template
|   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md     # Default pull request template
|   ├── SUPPORT.md                   # Support resources
|   └── ...                          # Other GitHub-specific files
├── LICENSE.md                       # Project license
├── README.md                        # Read me
└── ...                              # Other project files
```

Where all optional and GitHub-specific content is placed inside `.github` folder.
It's recommended to store other documentation in `doc` folder as described in [ep-gh-0002](#related).
