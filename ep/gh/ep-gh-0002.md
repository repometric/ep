## Abstract

This document contains the list of recommendations regarding project structure on GitHub. This project layout is intentionally generic and it doesn't try to impose a specific project structure and/or specific programming language.

## Motivation

Have the same, simple, easy to learn and use folder structure for any project and/or language.

## Proposal

Folder structure options and naming conventions:

```
.
├── .github/         # Reserved name for GitHub content
├── build/           # Compiled files
├── config/          # Config files
├── doc/             # Documentation files
├── ext/             # External dependencies 
├── script/          # Tools and utilities for development
├── src/             # Source files
├── test/            # Automated tests
```

## Unresolved

- several nested folders (for deploy, etc.)
- reserved names (like node_modules)
- environment-specific settings (dev1, dev2, staging, prod)
- ignore rules
